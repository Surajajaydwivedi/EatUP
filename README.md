EatUP is a web service specially aimed for smaller scale restaurants, in the times of pandemic to reduce human interaction. 

It lets the customers order food via scanning a QR code at each table and also pre register a table or book order before hand, or order for home delivery. 

It also lets the hotel owner control everything from orders to the menu, all without the need of any external app.
